# [CS50AI Week 2, Uncertainty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2023/weeks/2/) - [Heredity](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2023/projects/2/heredity/)
An AI that assesses the likelihood that a person will have a particular genetic trait using Basian Network.

## Summary

We use the Bayesian Network to model a population. Given information about people, who their parents are, and whether they have a particular observable trait (e.g. hearing loss) caused by a given gene, our AI will infer the probability distribution for each personâ€™s genes, as well as the probability distribution for whether any person will exhibit the trait in question.
